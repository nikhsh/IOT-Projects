arduino uno  is the another option to coding on iot 

in this i can perfrom  IR sensor, soil measurement sensor, somke detection , rain detection sensor , and ldr sensor , bpm sensor to measure the heartbeat pulse or more..
in this use in  arduino ide software to perfrom this operation..
in this use coding language is c..


in IR sensor :- in this code  i can to when object is detaction the led is automatically on 

soil measurement sensor :-  in this code  we can also do  the how to level on water to detection and also second is that to be only detection on the water...

rain detection sensor :-  in this code we can to if rain is came to show alart of them amd also to speed of the rain also show of them...

somke sensor : - in this smoke sensor to show if somke is detection this go to range 200 + this is detection of them...

ldr sensor :-  in this ldr sensor to when evening mood is on and the sensor detect the dark ness then autim automatically on the led of tem 

bpm sensor : - to include a libaray and this is the show our bpm of them...
